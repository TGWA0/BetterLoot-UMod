v4.1.7 Naval Update Fixes

- Added new deep sea NPCs
- Added additional filter parameter for certain unloaded assets being caught in container list filter.
- Changed container script to force update on load to add missing prefabs to maintain integrity of available choices.
	- You can now selectively disable a prefab by setting its value in the config to false instead of removing the entire entry from the watch list.
	- New prefabs found on wipe day will be automatically enabled.
